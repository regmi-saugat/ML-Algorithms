# Linear Regression

**Linear Regression** is one of the simplest machine learning algorithm that we use. It can be described as :

- It is supervised machine learning algorithm which main aim is to find a line that minimizes the prediction error of all data points.
- Linear approach to modeling the relationship between dependent variable(Y) and one or more independent variables(X).

When we fit a line to data using linear regression, we optimize the **slope and intercept**. Linear Regression predicts continuous numerical values based on the given data points.
